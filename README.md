- ##  relationship between the input features and the target variable."
- ## These relationships are generally classified into two types: linear and nonlinear.

## Linear Relationship 
- ### A linear model assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable.
  - [Classification](#classification)
  - [Regression](#regression)
  - ### Classification
    - Whether classification is 
        - linear  
        - nonlinear 
    - depends on both 
        - the model used and 
        - the nature of the data 
    - linear models like 
        - Logistic Regression  
        - Linear SVM create linear decision boundaries
        - Perceptron
        - RidgeClassifier
    - while nonlinear models like 
        - K-Nearest Neighbors(KNN) 
        - SVM with RBF kernel can capture complex nonlinear
        - Decision Trees
        - Naive Bayes
        - Gradient Boosting
        - Neural Networks 
         patterns in the data
  - ### Regression


## NonLinear Relationship
- ### "A nonlinear relationship means that the change in the target variable is not proportional to the change in the input features. The relationship between them cannot be represented by a straight line."

- ### "In a nonlinear relationship, the target variable depends on the input features in a complex, non-proportional way."
- ### "A nonlinear relationship exists between the input features and the target variable.
